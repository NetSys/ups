Logs stored (replace <scheme> with a scheme name listed above):
1. <scheme>.internet2-1Gbps-10Gbps-70.pcts and lstf-<scheme>.internet2-1Gbps-10Gbps-70.pct: Packet Completion Times (or Packet Delay) obtained for <scheme> and its LSTF replay respectively.
Format: <PCT in ns> <source id> <dest id> <flow id> <seq in no.of packets> <time when packet reaches dest in sec> <time when packet reaches dest in ns>
2. <scheme>.internet2-1Gbps-10Gbps-70.fcts and lstf-<scheme>.internet2-1Gbps-10Gbps-70.fcts: FCTs obtained for <scheme> and its LSTF replay respectively.
Format: <FCT in ns> <source id> <dest id> <flow id> <no. of packets in flow - 1> <time when flow finishes in sec> 
3. <scheme>.internet2-1Gbps-10Gbps-70.compare: List of packets that miss their target output times when replaying a <scheme>
Format: <flowid> <seq in no. of packets> : <congestion free PCT> <PCT with LSTF> >  <original PCT> by <Difference between the two PCTs>
4. <scheme>.internet2-1Gbps-10Gbps-70.ratios: Ratio of queuing delay with LSTF and with original <scheme>.
Format: <flowid> <seq in no. of packets> : <PCT with LSTF> <original PCT> <Ratio of the two PCTs> <Relative difference between the two PCTs>

Computed results (replace <scheme> with a scheme name listed above):
1. late-packets-<scheme>.internet2-1Gbps-10Gbps-70: Number of packets delayed, bucketed by the amount delayed in multiples of bottleneck transmission time.

Scripts used for computing results from logs: findLatePackets.py called by get-num-late-packets.sh (which in turn is called by the main script in tcl/ex/ups/scripts)
