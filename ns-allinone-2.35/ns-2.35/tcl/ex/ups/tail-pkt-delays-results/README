Schemes:
1. fifo
2. tailPktDelayLstf (LSTF with all packets initialized with the same slack value)

Logs stored (replace <scheme> with a scheme name listed above):
1. <scheme>.internet2-1Gbps-10Gbps-70.pcts: Packet Completion Times (or Packet Delays) obtained for <scheme>
Format: <PCT in nanoseconds> <source id> <dest id> <flow id> <seq in no. of packets> <time when packet reaches dest in sec> <time when packet reaches dest in nanoseconds>
2. <scheme>.internet2-1Gbps-10Gbps-70.fcts: FCTs obtained for <scheme> 
Format: <FCT in nanoseconds> <source id> <dest id> <flow id> <no. of packets in flow - 1> <time when flow finishes in sec> 

Computed results (replace <scheme> with a scheme name listed above):
1. fair-ccdf-pct-<scheme>.internet2-1Gbps-10Gbps-70-ccdf: Complementary CDF of packet delays with scheme
2. fair-ccdf-pct-<scheme>.internet2-1Gbps-10Gbps-70-mean: Mean packet delays with scheme

Scripts used for computing results from logs: findCompletionTimeCCdf-fair.py called by the main script in tcl/ex/ups/scripts. It uses flow IDs generated by getFlowSizesTillSimTime-withTime.py.
