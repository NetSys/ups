WHAT'S XGRAPH?
--------------

Welcome to the VINT release of xgraph.
Xgraph is an X-Windows application that includes:

  - interactive plotting and graphing, by David Harrison of UC Berkeley
  - animation and deritives, added by Paul Walker of NCSA
  - portability and bug fixes, by the VINT project

 
WHAT'S NEW IN 12.1?
-------------------

Release 12.1 is the first release by the VINT project.
(Thanks to Paul Walker and NCSA for letting us take over maintenence.)
This release includes several bug and portability fixes
and now uses GNU configure instead of imake.

If you already have a working xgraph, there's little need to upgrade.
If you had trouble getting xgraph to build, this version should be
easier to build.

We do not plan major feature enhancements to xgraph, but we do plan to
incorporate portability fixes.  At this time we believe xgraph builds
on Linux (RedHat 6.1), FreeBSD (3.x), and Solaris (2.5, 7).  Positive
and negative information about other platforms is welcome.
